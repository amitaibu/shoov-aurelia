    <h2>Recent UI builds</h2>
    <div class="description">
      Bellow are the recent UI regression builds.
      If a regression was found it will be listed here, otherwise if all images passed, it will not appear here.
      A build is identified by the git commit they were created in, so if you run your tests
      manually, you will find the screenshots under that commit.
